description: Ubiquitin is a small 76 amino-acid protein which is evolutionarily highly
  conserved in eukaryotic cells. Ubiquitination of proteasomal substrate proteins
  is performed by a complex system consisting of ubiquitin activating (E1) enzymes,
  ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes and substrate recognition proteins (E3 enzymes).
